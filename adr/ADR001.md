# ADR001 - Framework

## Status

[Proposed & Accepted]

## Context and Problem Statement

A simple website to represent as a resume.
To show an experiences and might some skill set.
The side needed to be easy to config in structure and style.

## Decision Drivers

Global css is required. all logic should be on the same page (file) => easy to config and debug.

feature that might needed

- responsive
- pages for each exp (?)
- link to badges (?)

## Considered Options

- **[AstroJs]**

  - Pros:
    - handle page easy
    - everything can be in a single page (js, html, css)
    - can be use with other framework (React, Vue, ...)
  - Cons:
    - has to implement css by self => take some time.

- **[NextJs with Tailwind]**
  - Pros:
    - tailwind implemented at start => easy to implement css
    - easy to add responsive classes
  - Cons:
    - tailwind package size
    - some tailwind experience required
    - documentation digging could take a while.
    - React only

## Chosen Option

AstroJS - due to the simplicity and lean package size

## Decision

- AstroJS - since it's a just informative website. JS might play a little role on this. Astro is more suited in this approach.
- NextJs - Only React support and it's an overkill for informative website.
- Tailwind is easy to use. however, the learning curve is steep. and the packages size is quite dramatic, compared with scss.
